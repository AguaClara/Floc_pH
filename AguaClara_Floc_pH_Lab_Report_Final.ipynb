        "The Unit Process Operations pH subteam wanted to explore the performance of the AguaClara sedimentation tank as a function of pH. Filtration within the sedimentation tank is complex and the performance is often a factor of floc blanket. When the coagulant dosage exceeds a certain amount, the pH probe will be coated with coagulant, leading to inaccurate pH measurements within the plant. Therefore, the team wanted to determine this coagulant dosage and use that value as the constant coagulant dosage for all experimental trials. The team hopes to use this information to uncover new insights on how filtration performance changes in different pH ranges."

        "## Introduction\n",
        "The performance of the AguaClara plant sed system most likely depends on three factors: pH, floc blanket depth, and coagulant dosage. However, the performance is difficult to measure when all factors are considered because a slight variation in each parameter could lead to drastically different and unexpected behavior. Moreover, a lack or excess of one parameter could lead to undrinkable water. This was the motivation for developing three subteams that explore the performance of the sed tank as a function of each parameter. By understanding how performance varies with each of these parameters, the subteams can provide insight for a possibly optimal combination of the three parameters for the plant scale and uncover ones of the mysteries in filtration. For the pH team, the challenge was that the pH probe can be easily coated with coagulant due to the relatively high dosages at the plant scale. Therefore, the team measured the steady state performance of the apparatus as a function of pH while keeping the coagulant dosage and floc blanket depth constant.  The flocculator and sed tank  used within the experiment was nearly identical to the ones used in the experiments varying coagulant dosage, and floc blanket depth, making pH the only variable within our system. ProCoDa and Python were used to develop stock solutions of acid or base and coagulant that would allow us to reach target pHs. A peristaltic pump automated the addition of acid stock solutions and aided in maintaining these target pH levels. \n",

        "This experiment has never been performed before by any AguaClara subteam; however, some subteams have worked on similar projects with the same setup. These teams instead varried the coagulant dosage or floc blanket depth in their experiments. In the \"Analysis and optimization of coagulation and flocculation process\" , optimal pH conditions were determined to be around 6, 7 and 8. These values were found by varying the coagulant dosages and finding the pH (V. Saritha, N. Srinivas, N. V. Srikanth Vuppala). \n",

        "The bottom geometry to be used for the tube settler was determined by previous High Rate Sedimentation teams. The most optimal angles for the sides of the bottom geometry were found to be 58 and 78 degrees. For this particular experiment, a 58 degree angle was used for the bottom geometry side walls. \n",
        "\n",
        "The High Rate Sedimentation team from Spring 2019 would run their experiments in intervals of 24 hours. This allowed for a steady state of the system to be reached where the influent turbidity was equal to the effluent turbidity. However, this approach was not effective because flocs would be stuck at the bottom which resulted in effective gelling which hinders the performance of the system. \n"

To account for the carbonate system, we first determined the Acid Neutralizing Capacity of tap water using ProCoda and developing and analyzing Gran Plots. After receiving a low error (less than 0.1 mL of titrant), we use this data and plug them within equations in a Python script and determined the amount of acid or base needed to adjust the pH to our target pHs: 5,6,7,8. We then developed stock solutions with concentrations that would allow our pump to deliver the required flows to cover the target pH range. The steady state performance of the system at each pH was measured and extra data points would be considered to provide a more information on pH vs performance. The data was then plotted and analyzed hoping to lead to a relationship between pH and performance and a possible performance maximization point. Observations about floc formation and floc blanket formation were recorded at different pHs in hopes of discovering some interesting behavior.\n"

        "This is the experimental setup for our apparatus. It containts four different streams of water, coagulant, stock solution of acid/base, and stock solution of clay going into their respective pumps. After these streams are all combined, this new stream is sent through the influent turbidimeter. Then the stream is sent through the flocculator with a pressure sensor connected in parallel. This pressure sensor is included because if the pressure is not great enough and there is headloss, flocculation will be much less effective. Monitoring the pressure throughout the flocculation process allows for making sure the water pressure is enough to make it through the flocculator. It is also important to not have too high of pressure because high pressure can result in equiment malfuncitoning. Afterwards the stream effluent of the flocculator is split into a bypass stream that mixes with the stream effluent of the floc weir and a stream going into the sedimentation tank. The stream exiting the sedimentation tank is split into a bypass and a stream that runs through the effluent turbidimeter. The bypasses are added to prevent a buildup of impurities in the system. Afterwards the pH is measured and the rest of the water runs through the waste pump. \n",

This velocity was in agreement with all of the other teams within the unit Process Analysis Subteams. This upflow velocity is espeically important as it affects the sedimentation in the tube settler and has the potential to cause issuses encountered with gelling and effulent turbitity calculations.\n",

In the experiment PID control is the state used to run the experments , stabilizing the the clay pump tokeep the infulent turbitiy stable at 100NTU. This is especially important as it is the standardized influent turbidity that is used for the AguaClara Sedimentation tanks. Also, it must be noted that the amount of clay kept constant at 40RMP.\n",
        "\n",
        "The results of the experiment showed that not having PID control clay stock in the experiment led to an excess of clay entering the system. This in turn increased the gelling in the tube settler.In additon, the experiment also showed that there were air bubbles pumped into the tube setttler, and this is due to the lack of clay stock. During the 24 hour period, when the team was not there it is hyporthesized that the clay stock may have ran out permaturely. This however does not affec the pumps as they ran without clay stock, resulting in air being pumped into the system.The presence of air bubbles within the system is also not ideal as it decreases the efficency of sedimenation, pushing the a water- sludge mixture upwards leaving no room for it to settle. \n",

        "After the 23rd hour, there is a pheomenal decrease in the effluent turbidiy to about 30NTU, and then remained there for the remained of the experiment. It is also hypothesized that if the experiment were to last a couple more hours this would have led to the decay of the floc blanket which would have led to an exponential increase in effluent turbitity. \n",
        "Lastly, it should also be noted that the turbity did not stabilze to 10NTU, which was the targeted value. This is hypothesized to be due to the lack of control of the amount of clay pumped into the system.

        "An experiment varying the pH of the water in the system has not yet been completed. The experiment that was ran was a baseline experiment that ran water through the system with clay and coagulant without varying the pH of the water. It was predicted that the system would reach steady state and the effluent turbidity would be equal to the influent turbidity. The results of this experiment do not match what was predicted. Originally, there was gelling in the floc weir which could have effected this. There were also leaks at the begining of the experiment that could have resulted in a loss of pressure in the tubing not allowing the flocs to exit the system. The main reason for the gelling in the apparatus was because of air bubbles in the system that entered through one of the stock solutions. "
